Use the abbreviation _Ave., Blvd. and St._ only with a numbered address: 
> _1600 Pennsylvania Ave._ 

Spell them out and capitalize when part of a formal street without a number: 
> _Pennsylvania Avenue._

Lowercase and spell out when used alone or with more than one street name: 
> _Massachusetts and Pennsylvania avenues._

All similar words _(alley, drive, road, terrace, etc.)_ always are spelled out. Capitalize them when part of a formal name without a number; lowercase when used alone or with two or more names.

Always use figures for an address number: 
> _9 Morningside Circle._

Spell out and capitalize First through Ninth when used as street names; use figures for 10th and above: 
> _7 Fifth Ave., 100 21st St._

Use periods in the abbreviation P.O. for P.O. Box numbers.


__Cities/states__

Capitalize city if part of a proper name, an integral part of an official name or a regularly used nickname: 
> _New York City, Kansas City, Windy City, City of Light._

Lowercase elsewhere: 
> _a Texas city, the city government, the city Board of Education;_ and all other city of phrases: _the city of Lexington._

Capitalize when part of a formal title before a name: 
>_City Manager Lynn Smithson._

Lowercase when not part of a formal title: 
> _city Health Commissioner Frank Smith_

Use a comma after the city and after the state: 
> _She was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1985._

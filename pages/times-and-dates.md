* Use figures for time, except noon and midnight: 

    > _9:30 a.m. – noon or midnight – 6 a.m._
  
* Abbreviate time of day with lower case letters separated by periods: 
  
   > _a.m./p.m._

* Times on the hour should not use zeroes:  

   > _9 – 10 a.m._
  
* Time not on the hour should use a colon to separate hours from minutes: 

    > _9:30 a.m._
  
* Do not put a 12 in front of noon: 

    > _Noon_, **not** _12 noon_.

* Avoid the redundant:

    > _11 p.m. tonight_.

* When the day follows the month, express it in cardinal figures: 

    > On _May 11_.

* When the day precedes the month or stands alone, express it in ordinal figures or ordinal numbers: 

    > _I arrive on the fifth of May and leave on the twenty-first._

* Abbreviate the month (except March, April, May, June and July) when it appears with the date, but not when it appears alone or with the year: 

    > _I was born on Sept. 15, 1983.  I was born in September 1983.  I was born in September._

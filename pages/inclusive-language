How to talk about age, disabilites, genders, race, sexuatility, etc. 

**Age**

> Make reference of age only when it is deemed relevant to the situation. If someone is quoted as saying, “I’m too old to go back to school,” the age is relevant. When referencing ages, always use figures.

>> •	Mary Catherine Yancey, 8, was awarded the prize. 

>> •	The building is 22 years old. 

>> •	The 5-year-old boy started kindergarten. 


**Disabled, handicapped**

>Do not use the word “disability” as a primary adjective, as if a disability is a person’s most important trait. Instead, use “person who uses a wheelchair,” or “people who are deaf.” Additionally, do not use language that portrays the person as passive or suggests a lack of something (victim, invalid, suffers from).  Avoid using altogether unless there is a compelling reason to use.

>**_Blind_**

>>Describes a person with complete or nearly complete loss of sight. Those who have partial sight may prefer the term low vision, limited vision or visually impaired. If possible, ask for a person’s preference. 

>**_Deaf_**

>>Describes a person with total or major hearing loss. Those with partial hearing loss are hard of hearing or partially deaf. Again, ask for a person’s preference. Note: When referring to Deaf culture, the d is capitalized. 

>**_Disabled_**

>>A general term used for a physical, mental, developmental or intellectual disability. Do not use mentally retarded.

>**_Handicap_**

>>_Handicapped_ is an outdated and unacceptable term to use when referring to individuals or accessible environments. 

>>>•	Accessible parking, not handicapped parking.

>>>•	Accessible restroom, not handicapped restroom.

**_Wheelchair user_**
> People use wheelchairs for independent mobility. Do not use confined to a wheelchair or wheelchair bound. If a wheelchair is needed, say why.

**Gender-neutral language**

>In general, use terms for jobs and roles that can apply to any gender. Such language aims to treat people equally and is inclusive of people whose gender identity is not strictly male or female. 

>Consider any word or term that has the effect of emphasizing one gender over another. For example _police officer instead of policeman. Door attendant instead of doorman. Councilmember instead of councilman._ 

>_Gender_ is not synonymous with _sex_. _Gender_ refers to a person’s social identity while _sex_ refers to biological characteristics. Not all people fall under one or two categories for _sex_ or _gender_, according to leading medical organizations, so avoid references to both, either or opposite sexes or genders as a way to encompass all people.


>**_He, she / his, her_**

>Do not presume maleness in constructing a sentence. Usually it is possible, and always preferable, to reword the sentence to avoid gender.

>>Incorrect: _An employee should have the approval of his/her supervisor._
>>Correct: _An employee should have the approval of their supervisor._
>>Incorrect: _His staff assistant._
>>Correct: _The division’s staff assistant._


>**_LGBT, LGBTQ_**

>>Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning and/or queer.


>**_Pride, pride_**

>> Capitalize Pride when referring to events or organizations honoring LGBTQ communities on subsequent references. _“Are you going to Pride?” she asked. Several cities are holding Pride events this weekend._


>**_Sexuality_**

>>Used to describe people attracted to members of the same sex, although _lesbian_ is the more common term for women. Preferred over _homosexual_. Include sexual orientation only when it is pertinent to a story, and avoid references to _sexual preference_ or to a _gay_ or _alternative lifestyle_.


>**_Transgender_**

>>An adjective that describes people whose gender identity does not match the sex they were identified as having at birth.

>>People who identify as gender nonconforming have a gender identity or expression that does not conform to the traditional gender binary. 


**Nonsexist writing**

>Avoid words like co-ed or housewife, which reinforce sexist stereotypes. Try to use the plural pronoun _they_ instead of _he_. Instead of _man_ or _mankind_, use _humans, human beings, humanity, women and men, people_ or _individuals_. 


**Race-related content**

> Avoid broad generalizations and labels; race and ethnicity are one part of a person’s identity. Consider carefully whether to identify people by race. Often, it is an irrelevant factor and drawing unnecessary attention to someone’s race or ethnicity can be interpreted as bigotry. There are, however, occasions when race is pertinent:

>> •	In stories that involve significant, groundbreaking or historical events such as being elected U.S. president, being named to the U.S. Supreme Court or other notable occurrences. _Barack Obama was the first black U.S. president._ 

>> •	In cases where suspects or missing persons are being sought, and the descriptions provided are detailed and not solely racial. _Police are looking for man described as white, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, with black hair and blue eyes, wearing a plaid shirt and a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap!_

>> •	When reporting a demonstration, disturbance or other conflict involving race or issues like civil rights. 

>**_African American_**

>> No hyphen. Acceptable for an American black person of African descent. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. Americans of Caribbean heritage, for example, generally refer to themselves as _Caribbean American_. Follow a person’s preference.


>**_Asian American_**

>>No hyphen. Acceptable for an American of Asian descent. When possible, refer to a person's country of origin or follow the person's preference.


>**_Black_**

>>Acceptable as an adjective. Not strictly synonymous with African Americans. If specific ethnicity is known, use that.

>**_Caucasian_**

>>Avoid as a synonym for white, unless in a quotation.


>**_People of color, racial minority_**

>>The terms people of color and racial minority/minorities are generally acceptable terms to describe people of races other than white in the United States. Avoid using POC. When talking about just one group, be specific: Chinese Americans or members of the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida. Avoid referring to an individual as a minority unless in a quotation. 


>**_biracial, multiracial_**

>>Acceptable, when clearly relevant, to describe people with more than one racial heritage. Usually more useful when describing large, diverse groups of people than individuals. Avoid mixed-race, which can carry negative connotations, unless a story subject prefers that term. Example: She has an African American father and a white mother instead of She is biracial. 

>**_Latino/Latina_**

>>Latino is often preferred noun or adjective for a person from, or whose ancestors were from, a Spanish-speaking land or culture or from Latin America. Latina is the feminie form. So prefer the gender neutral tern Latinx, which should be confined to quitations, nanes of organixations or individuals who request it. Hernandez preders the gender-neutral term Lantinx. For groups of females, use the plural Latinas; for groups of males or of mixed gender, use the plural Latinos. Hispanixs is alos generally accptable for those int he U.S. Use more specific identification when possible, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Brazilian or Mexican American.

>**_Hispanic_**

>>Refers to a person from – or whose ancestors were from – a Spanish-speaking land or culture. Latino or Latina are sometimes preferred. Follow individual preferences when known. Use a more specific identification when possible such as Cuban, Puerto Rican or Mexican American if such a designation is pertinent.

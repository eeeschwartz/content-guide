title: Capitalization

In general, avoid unnecessary capitals. Use a capital letter only if you can justify it by one of the following principles listed:

* Proper nouns: _Jessica, Jeff, America, Lexington_.
* Proper names: Capitalize common nouns such as party, river and south when they are an integral part of the full name for a person, place or thing:  _Democratic Party, Kentucky River, North Carolina_.
* Lowercase these common nouns when they stand alone in subsequent references: _the party, the river, the street_.
* Lowercase the common noun elements of names in plural uses:  _Ecton and Cheapside parks, Main and Maxwell streets_.
* Sentences: Capitalize the first word in a statement that stands as a sentence.
* Titles:  Capitalize formal titles when used immediately before a name. Lower case formal titles when used alone or in constructions that set them off from a name by commas.

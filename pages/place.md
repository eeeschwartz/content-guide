* The names of the 50 states should be spelled out when used in the body of a story, whether standing alone or in conjunction with a city, town, village or military base. 

* Lowercase in all state of constructions: the state of Maine, the states of Main and Vermont.

* Four states – Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia – are legally commonwealths instead of states. The distinction is necessary only in formal uses: The commonwealth of Kentucky filed a lawsuit. For simple geographic reference: Tobacco is grown in the state of Kentucky. 

*	Do not capitalize state when used simply as an adjective to specify a level of jurisdiction: state Rep. William Smith, the state Transportation Department, state funds. Apply the same principle to phrases such as the city of Lexington, the town of Auburn, etc. 

*	Use the state abbreviations listed below with the name of a city, town, village or military base in most datelines and in lists, agate and tabular material.

* When addressing letters, envelopes, abbreviate state per the U.S. Postal Service’s format. Postal code abbreviations are in parentheses.

How to talk about age, disabilities, genders, race, sexuality, etc. 

**Age**

> Make reference of age only when it is deemed relevant to the situation. If someone is quoted as saying, “_I’m too old to go back to school,_” the age is relevant. Generally, use ages for profiles, obituaries, significant career milestones and achievements unusual for the age. When referencing ages, always use figures.

>> •	Mary Catherine Yancey, 8, was awarded the prize. 

>> •	The building is 22 years old. 

>> •	The 5-year-old boy started kindergarten. 


**Disabled, handicapped**

> Use care and precision, considering the impact of specific words and the terms used by the people you are writing about. When possible, ask people how they want to be described. Be mindful that the question of identity-first vs. person-first language is vital for many. 

>The terms disabilities and disabled are generally embraced by disabled people and are acceptable when relevant. Do not use _handicap_ for a disability or _handicapped_ for a person. 

> In general, refer to a disability only if relevant to the story, and if a medical diagnosis has been made or the person uses the term.
If a disability is pertinent to the story, provide brief details explaining that relevance. For example: _Merritt, who is blind and walks with the help of a guide dog, said she is pleased with the city’s walkway improvements._ 

> Do not use words that suggest pity, such as _afflicted with, battling or suffers from_ any disability or illness, or that a person has _overcame her disability_. Instead: _has cancer, being treated for ADHD._
 
> Do not use negative or condescending language such as _wheelchair-bound_ or _Alzheimer’s victim_. Instead use accurate, neutral language such as _uses a wheelchair_ or _a person with Alzheimer’s disease._ 


>**_Blind, limited vision, low vision/partially sighted_**

>>_Blind_ describes a person with complete loss of sight. Blind, along with terms such as person/people with low vision, person/people with limited vision, person/people with vision loss, partially sighted person/people are acceptable if an individual or group uses them for themselves. When possible, ask if a person or group uses identity-first language (blind students) or person-first language (students who are blind).


>**_deaf, Deaf, hard of hearing_**

>>Use the lowercase form _deaf_ for the audiological condition of total or major hearing loss and for people with total or major hearing loss, when relevant to the story. Use the uppercase form (Deaf) to signify the culture. Example: _Derek, who is deaf, said the Deaf community is a powerful force in his life_. If possible, ask for a person’s preference.


>**_Handicap, handicapped_**

>>Do not use those terms for a disability or a person. Avoid uses such as _handicapped parking_; instead, _accessible parking_. Terms such as _golf handicap_ or _handicapping a race_ are acceptable.


**_Wheelchair user_**

> People use wheelchairs for independent mobility. Do not use _confined to a wheelchair_ or _wheelchair-bound_. If a wheelchair is needed and that fact is relevant to the story, make sure the relevance is clear.

**_Gender-neutral language_**

>In general, use terms for jobs and roles that can apply to any gender. Such language aims to treat people equally and is inclusive of people whose gender identity is not strictly male or female. 

>Consider any word or term that has the effect of emphasizing one gender over another. For example _police officer instead of policeman. Door attendant instead of doorman. Councilmember instead of councilman._ 


**_Gender, sex and sexual orientation_**

>Gender refers to internal and social identity and often corresponds with but is not synonymous with _sex_. _Gender_ refers to a person’s social identity while _sex_ refers to biological characteristics. Not all people fall under one or two categories for _sex_ or _gender_, according to leading medical organizations, so avoid references to both, either or opposite sexes or genders as a way to encompass all people.


>**_He, she / his, her_**

>Do not presume maleness in constructing a sentence. Do not use constructions such as his/her, his or her or he or she, etc. As much as possible, use they/them/their as a way of accurately describing and representing a person who uses those pronouns for themselves. Usually it is possible, and always preferable, to reword the sentence to avoid gender.

>>Incorrect: _An employee should have the approval of his/her supervisor._
>>Correct: _An employee should have the approval of their supervisor._
>>Incorrect: _His staff assistant._
>>Correct: _The division’s staff assistant._


>**_LGBT, LGBTQ_**

>>Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and/or questioning.


>**_Pride, pride_**

>> Capitalize _Pride_ when referring to events or organizations honoring LGBTQ communities on subsequent references. _“Are you going to Pride?” she asked. Several cities are holding Pride events this weekend._ Lowercase _pride_ when referring to generic events or the general concept of LGBTQ pride. _He attended a gay pride event._


>**_Sexual orientation_**

>>Include sexual orientation only when relevant to the subject matter, and do so only if the information is verified. Avoid references to _sexual preference_ or to _a gay_ or _alternative lifestyle_. Avoid _homosexual_ to describe people, though _homosexuality_ is acceptable as a noun for the concept of same-sex attraction.


>**_Transgender_**

>>Describes people whose gender identity does not match the one usually associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. Identify people as _transgender_ only when relevant, and use the name by which they live publicly.


**Nonsexist writing**

>Avoid words like co-ed or housewife, which reinforce sexist stereotypes. Try to use the plural pronoun _they_ instead of _he_. Instead of _man_ or _mankind_, use _humans, human beings, humanity, women and men, people_ or _individuals_. 


**Race-related content**

> Avoid broad generalizations and labels; race and ethnicity are one part of a person’s identity. Consider carefully whether to identify people by race. Often, it is an irrelevant factor and drawing unnecessary attention to someone’s race or ethnicity can be interpreted as bigotry. There are, however, occasions when race is pertinent:

>> •	In stories that involve significant, groundbreaking or historical events such as being elected U.S. president, being named to the U.S. Supreme Court or other notable occurrences. _Barack Obama was the first black U.S. president._ 

>> •	In cases where suspects or missing persons are being sought, and the descriptions provided are detailed and not solely racial. _Police are looking for man described as white, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, with black hair and blue eyes, wearing a plaid shirt and a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap!_

>> •	When reporting a demonstration, disturbance or other conflict involving race or issues like civil rights. 


>**_African American_**

>> No hyphen for this or other dual-heritage terms. Acceptable for an American Black person of African descent. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. Americans of Caribbean heritage, for example, generally refer to themselves as _Caribbean American_. Follow a person’s preference.


>**_Asian American_**

>>No hyphen. Acceptable for an American of Asian descent. When possible, refer to a person's country of origin or follow the person's preference.


>**_Black_**

>>Use the capitalized term as an adjective in a racial, ethnic or cultural sense: Black people, Black culture, Black literature, Black studies, Black colleges.

>>African American is also acceptable for those in the U.S. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. Americans of Caribbean heritage, for example, generally refer to themselves as _Caribbean American_. Follow a person’s preference if known, and be specific when possible and relevant. 


>**_Brown_**

>>Avoid this broad and imprecise term in racial, ethnic or cultural references unless a part of a direct quotation. Interpretations of what the term includes vary widely. Be specific. 


>**_Caucasian_**

>>Avoid as a synonym for white, unless in a quotation.


>**_People of color_**

>>The term is acceptable when necessary in broad references to multiple races other than white. _We will hire more people of color. Nine playwrights of color collaborated on the script._ Be aware, however, that many people of various races object to the term for various reasons, including that it lumps together into one monolithic group anyone who isn’t white. 

>>Be specific whenever possible by referring to, for instance, _Black Americans, Chinese Americans or members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida._ Example: _The poll found that Black and Latino Americans are bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s financial impact_, not_ The poll found that people of color are bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s financial impact_.

>>Do not use _person of color_ for an individual. Do not use _POC, BIPOC or BAME_ unless necessary in a direct quotation; when used, explain it. 


>**_biracial, multiracial_**

>>Acceptable, when clearly relevant, to describe people with more than one racial heritage. Usually more useful when describing large, diverse groups of people than individuals. Avoid _mixed-race_, which can carry negative connotations, unless a story subject prefers that term. Be specific, if possible, and then use _biracial_ for people of two heritages or _multiracial_ for those of two or more subsequent references if needed. Example: _She has an African American father and a white mother instead of She is biracial_. 


>**_Latino/Latina_**

>>_Latino_ is often preferred noun or adjective for a person from, or whose ancestors were from, a Spanish-speaking land or culture or from Latin America. _Latina_ is the female form. Some prefer the gender neutral term _Latinx_, which should be confined to quotations, names of organizations or individuals who request it. _Hernandez prefers the gender-neutral term Lantinx_. For groups of females, use the plural _Latinas_; for groups of males or of mixed gender, use the plural _Latinos_. _Hispanics_ is also generally accptable for those in the U.S. Use more specific identification when possible, such as _Cuban, Puerto Rican, Brazilian or Mexican American_.

>**_Hispanic_**

>>Refers to a person from – or whose ancestors were from – a Spanish-speaking land or culture. _Latino_ or _Latina_ are sometimes preferred. Follow individual preferences when known. Use a more specific identification when possible such as _Cuban, Puerto Rican or Mexican American_ if such a designation is pertinent.
